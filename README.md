#learning #ruby #sinatra. I was looking for a good project to learn ruby sinatra framework and found a good one on JumpstartLabs tutorials. Decided to do it and this is it. I'm also doing all the additional features listed in there and adding in my own stuffs. The tutorial project can be found here : http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html .
